### THiS iS A LETTER THAT HAS BEEN WAiTiNG, FOR 345 DAYS

to Banban â–².:

â€‹		First, Happy 15th Birthday to You! ðŸŽ‰

â€‹		The person who sent this blessing is an ordinary person, called **SEALchan P.S. (é›¾è‰²æ·±æµ·_sc)**. Now let me tell a story.

â€‹		When I was in the eighth grade, I was still an unpopular student in the class that not many people wanted to be friends with. When I was in the "Doki Doki Ruohann Club", some people constantly bullied me, and when I thought of them, I was so scared that I couldn't sleep. In those days, they created a lot of rumors. They treated the people around me and me with indifference. They were like a sharp knife that stabbed me.

â€‹		Finally, you came into my life.

â€‹		Hard for me to remember clearly what happened in those days and how you got to know me. It seemed that this happened by chance but not happened by chance. That night, we made friends, had a friendly chat on the Internet, and were surprised to find out that you and I had common interests. At that moment, I wanted to share everything I had with you. I regarded you not only as one of my best friends but also as a bright light that shone into the dark place and saved me.

â€‹		You may not believe this, but this is what I thought about at that time. Maybe, I was so thirsty for help from you. I had been tired of those useless words from "them".

â€‹		They were still spreading rumors and even more. Because I violated their so-called interests and their "BELIEF" "you don't deserve to be friends with others". If they were irreversible wounds, then you, who brought me help at that time, were like a Goddess in the world of bliss that could heal my wounds. And this time, this Goddess **is real**. I recalled a day a few months ago. That day, I was terrified and sad. I thought I couldn't stand this kind of life anymore, so I walked to the bridge after putting on my clothes and saying goodbye to my family. I tried my best to bear the pain in my heart without telling you all. I was afraid you would think I'm a pessimist so that you may resent me. But you didn't. You comforted me with warm words, letting me not worry and fear, and let me know that words can convey kindness and warmth. One noon, when I woke up from a nap, I suddenly thought of you, the Goddess who had saved me in the darkness.

â€‹		I even doubted myself: is everything real or only existing in my dream? Do I deserve to talk to such an excellent person? Do I ... ðŸ˜­So in those days, I was looking forward to seeing you at school. I was looking forward to riding home every night to chat with you, and ... Your words were the only motivation for my life. I spent the whole night reading all your public posts on Qzone and making comments on each of them. (I'm the repeating machine. (?)) I created a new Page in Notion to record your words and hobbies. I tried to remember every detail of you.

â€‹		I began to understand what genuine care and friendship are. You are like a bright light at any time, warming me, who was crying alone in a dark corner of the wall. Your choice to accept this imperfect and incomplete me moved me a lot.

â€‹		Everything in the world was still clear and bright in 2022. At 07:51:46 a.m. on January 11th, the sun rose, as usual, lighting up the world. After 10 hours, 2 minutes, and 32 seconds, the sun fell on the horizon at 17:54:18.

â€‹		At this moment, I have a lot to tell you. After all, I'm just an ordinary person. Sometimes I say to SEALYikang P.S. that you will be a great person in the future and become the person you want to be. If I am lucky enough to see this day, my life will be enough because I am ordinary. No matter how hard I try to shine, I can only light up very little darkness. However, my little tiny light is lucky to be one of the millions of light illuminating you! Even though my light is small, I am already fortunate. That's enough, that's enough.

â€‹		Maybe the world is someone's fantasy, and people are the characters in it. But on the day after 650 thousand hours, when everything in the world is oxidized and gone with the wind, you and I will become two bubbles on a glass of beer or two grains of dust under a street lamp. At that moment, in the Milky way and under the beautiful starry sky, everyone will be eternal.
